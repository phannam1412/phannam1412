# Principles of Learning 

## 1. Explore

Expore new things, new knowledge, knowing if a solution/library/framework/technique/skills exists.

Exporing increases your tools for troubleshooting a problem, designing a solution.

Some knowledge are easy to understand, some knowledge are hard to understand, for hard-to-understand thing, don't try to understand it, just know it. 

Exploring is not about trying to understand thing, exploring is about to gain as much knowledge of the outsite world as possible.

Best time for exploring: at the start of a day or at night time. 

Don't explore when your mind are tired or have read to much in that day, your mind need to fresh in order to achieve a better knowledge gaining.

## 2. Understand common, repeated problems

Understanding means that you really understand the problem to its root cause, how it work internally. All problems that happening again and again in your daily life must be understood clearly.

When you truly understand it, it's much easier for you to troubleshoot a problem, save a lots of time dealing with common, repeated problems. If you don't understand it and start your hacking, work-around, you will likely take time for troubleshooting it again in the future.

It's very welcoming when you not only understand repeated problems but also all problems that you have faced.

## 3. Deep dive

Understand very deeply a particular topic, problem, solution, technique...

All things are created based on foundation layer, or building blocks, so understanding building block is a critical path in fast learning and quickly understanding things in application layer, easier in troubleshooting things.

Choose some topics that you're really interested in and deep dive into it, when you truly understand it, other related things start make sense to you.

## 4. Re-think

Review/revise your existing solution and knowledge to ensure that you have properly understand it.

Sometimes your so-called solution is not actually a solution, your understanding of something is quite abstract and not proper. Re-thinking promotes a consolidation of your knowledge to make it better every day.

If Explore is to gain knowledge, Re-think is to organize knowledge into a logical structure.

Everytime when you face a previous problem again, re-thinking about it, revisiting the solution to ensure your solution is proper and up-to-date.

## 5. Maintenance

Always spend time reading/practicing again and again what you have known/understood.

The fact that human brain has a short-term memory, in order to prevent it, knowledge maintenance helps maintain up-to-date knowledge.

Keep reading, revising what you have known for at least once a week. 
Surfing and answering on social network also help reminding your knowledge. 
Helping your colleges, teammate in their problems.
