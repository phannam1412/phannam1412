# Principles of fast learning 

1. Explore: always expore new knowledge, you don't need to understand it, knowing it is enough. It's important for you to know if a solution exists when you're solving a problem

2. Understand: you need to understand something that are repeated or happen in your daily life, when you truly understand it, it's much easier for you to troubleshoot a problem.

3. Deep dive: choose some topics that you're really interested in and deep dive into it, the most foundation thing is the basic building block for all things, when you truly understand it, other related things start make sense to you.

4. Re-think: always review your existing solution and knowledge to ensure that you have properly understand it.

5. Maintenance: the fact that human brain has a short-term memory, so always spend time reading/practicing again and again what you have known/understood to maintain your up-to-date knowledge.
